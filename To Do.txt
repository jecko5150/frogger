- Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom and listen for up

- Create cars that are 20 pix high 40 pix wide that are randomly generated that move from left to to right. Not in top 50 pix or bottom 50 pix
HINT: generate a new care only every 6th game loop

- Detect when turtle hits a car (stop the game)

- Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached the FINISH_LINE_Y). When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars. Hint: think about creating an attribute and using the MOVE_INCREMENT to increase the car speed.

-
Create a scoreboard that keeps track of which level the user is on. Every time the turtle player does a successful crossing, the level should increase. When the turtle hits a car, GAME OVER should be displayed in the centre. If you get stuck, check the video walkthrough in Step 7
